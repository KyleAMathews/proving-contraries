Here in Silicon Valley, there's a meme going around about a powerful
reasoning method. It's normally described as "[reasoning from 1st
principles](http://jamesclear.com/first-principles)".

Most reasoning, the meme goes, is done by imitation or analogy.

We ask:

* "what have I or someone else done in similar situations in the past and
how does that apply to my current situation?".
* "What would someone I respect do in this situation?"
* "How would my mother discipline my child?"
* "What would Jesus do?"
* "How does my manager approach situations like this?"
* "How do other sunday school teachers handle off-topic questions?"

Reasoning from 1st principles, by contrast, asks you to return to the
fundamental truths you know to be true and reason up from there.

If you're worried about how you discipline your children you might ask:

* "Why do we have children?"
* "What is my responsibility to them?"
* "What underlies human behavior?"
* "How do people learn?"
* "What does learning mean anyways?"
* "What am I actually trying to accomplish when I 'discipline' my
children?"
* "What are my various emotional/mental states when I'm around my
children?"
* "How do I know if my "discipline" is actually helping them?"

By continually asking and following these types of questions downward,
we find and deeply understand the fundamental truths that underlie our
specific problem. Armed with this renewed source of understanding, we can now
reason more clearly about our problem.

Returning to our child discipline example, in the course of your
pondering and asking and following answers downward you might reread
[Doctrine and Covenants
121](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121):

>**41** No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the
>  priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and
>  meekness, and by love unfeigned;
>
>**42** By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the
  soul without hypocrisy, and without guile—
>
>**43** Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy
  Ghost; and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward
  him whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy;
>
>**44** That he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than the cords
  of death.

Reading these fundamental truths you might realize that your discipline
is sometimes not "kind" nor are you always "long-suffering" and "gentle".
You might ask yourself, "am I really trying to "enlarge the soul" of
my children?" "Do my children know without a doubt that my 'faithfulness
is stronger than the cords of death'?".

Elon Musk, the "Steve Jobs" of our era, is a big proponent of arguing
from 1st principles. In [an
interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-s_3b5fRd8) he talked about
his reasoning process before starting Tesla:

>I think it is important to reason from first principles rather than by
>analogy. The normal way we conduct our lives is we reason by analogy.
>[When reasoning by analogy] we are doing this because it’s like
>something else that was done or it is like what other people are doing
>— slight iterations on a theme.
>
>First principles is kind of a physics way of looking at the world. You
>boil things down to the most fundamental truths and say, “What are we
>sure is true?” … and then reason up from there.
>
>Somebody could say, “Battery packs are really expensive and that’s just
>the way they will always be… Historically, it has cost $600 per
>kilowatt hour. It’s not going to be much better than that in the
>future.”
>
>With first principles, you say, "What are the material constituents of
>the batteries? What is the stock market value of the material
>constituents?"
>
>It’s got cobalt, nickel, aluminum, carbon, some polymers for separation
>and a seal can. Break that down on a material basis and say, “If we
>bought that on the London Metal Exchange what would each of those
>things cost?”
>
>It’s like $80 per kilowatt hour. So clearly you just need to think of
>clever ways to take those materials and combine them into the shape of
>a battery cell and you can have batteries that are much, much cheaper
>than anyone realizes.”

But as he's has said elsewhere, reasoning from first principles is
*hard*. It's a costly, time-consuming way to make a decision.

If we view various methods of decision-making as tools, we could say
that reasoning by analogy/imitation is our common, inexpensive everyday
tool and reasoning from first principles is the costly power tool we use to
tackle unusual challenges or get us out of trouble when we're stuck.

Reasoning by analogy/imitation means you can only handle challenges that
*you or someone similar to you has already handled*. So hit a novel
challenge and you're stuck. Reasoning from 1st principles is a creative,
inventive thinking process for discovering new ways to handle novel
situations.

Like it or not, we all face things we don't know how to handle. What are
some of these?

##### When we need a unique advantage
* Entrepreneurship. You need to see things others don't see.
* Where unusally high performance is needed e.g. grad school,
difficult new job, a high-profile leadership position, etc.

##### When we're stuck on a problem or underperforming
* struggling with an important relationship
* floundering in job/career
* a faith crisis

##### When we face an unusually hard decision
* which college do I attend?
* Which career path do I choose?
* Do I date this person?
* Do I take this job across the country?
* Do I hire/fire this person?
* Should I remain friends with this person?

##### When adopting/adapting to a new identity
* leaving home
* getting married
* birth of first child
* changing jobs
* retiring
* lose of spouse

##### During periods of rapid change
* working at a fast growing company
* when facing multiple challenges

One of my favorite life lessons from being a software engineer is that
the key to minimizing pain from screwups or unexpected problems is *not*
to try to avoid them altogether but to learn how to detect them early
and fix them quickly.

Some software teams dread downtime and bugs and spend enormous amounts of
effort to avoid problems... and still have them.

Other software teams setup ways to quickly detect when there's
trouble and discover procedures for quickly fixing them.

The second teams tend to have far less trouble from problems *AND* are
*far* more productive (and happy).

If there's one guarentee in life it's that you're going to have to face
things over and over that you don't know how to face.

One option is to dread unexpected problems [^1] and contort your life in
any number of ways to avoid them.

Another option is is to learn how to face novel problems as they
arise and learn quickly on your feet (in part through 1st principle
thinking).

As [Joseph Smith said](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Joseph_Smith,_Jr.),
"A man is saved *no faster* than he gets knowledge" — saved in both a
spiritual sense and saved from our troubles and woes.

Joseph said on another occasion:

>The things of God  are of deep import, and time and experience and
>careful and ponderous and solemn thoughts can only  find them out. Thy
>mind, O Man, if thou wilt lead a soul  unto salvation, *must stretch as
>high as the utmost Heavens, and search into and contemplate the  lowest
>considerations of the darkest abyss, and expand upon the broad
>considerations of eternal  expanse; he must commune with God*. How much
>more dignified and noble are the thoughts of God,  than the vain
>imaginations of the human heart, none but fools will trifle with the
>souls of  men.

If we don't grapple with fundamental ideas then we're left, like the
enchained slaves of Plato's cave, seeing only shadows of truths.

When [Brigham Young was asked why God’s determining hand did not more
often intercede for the
Saints](https://www.lds.org/ensign/1983/03/meekness-a-dimension-of-true-discipleship?lang=eng),
he replied:

>Man is destined to be a God, has to act as an independent being, and is
left [by God] to see what he will do, to practice depending on his own
resources, to be righteous in the dark, to do the best he can when left
to himself to show his capacity.

Reasoning from 1st principles doesn't protect us from bad decisions. We
can be wrong about fundamentals truths. Our reasoning can be blinded by
our fears.  But in the end, there's no way to progress in knowledge of
God and Man unless we learn to think deep.

[^1]: A coward dies a thousand times before his death, but the valiant
taste of death but once. It seems to me most strange that men should
fear, seeing that death, a necessary end, will come when it will come.
— William Shakespeare
