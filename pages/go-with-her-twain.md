*"Ye yourselves will succor those that stand in need of your succor; ye will administer of your substance unto him that standeth in need; and ye will not suffer that the beggar putteth up [her] petition to you in vain, and turn [her] out to perish."*  -[ Mosiah 4:16](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4)

Saturday afternoon, I decided to enjoy the sunny California weather and take a roundabout 3.5 mile walk to work, stopping to get Panda Express along the way.  As I approached the shopping center, I noticed a little, middle-aged black woman sitting outside the restaurant, asking for money.

Next to her was a single grocery bag, containing toilet paper.  And it looked like someone else had bought her a drink and a sandwich.

My thoughts turned to an[ article](http://puremormonism.blogspot.com/2016/06/the-refiners-fire.html) a few weeks ago.  A man in Sacramento chronicled his scripture-inspired decision to stop and offer to help the homeless as often as he can.  He realized that to truly be a Christian, he can’t outsource compassion to the Church or the government – he himself needs to serve real people in real life: "Doing my meager part to assist someone in having a bite to eat now and then turns out to be the one thing I can do that actually brings me closer to God."

A few days later, I came across a story (I forget where – I may be conflating two different ones) on racial tensions in America.  It suggested that the best thing we all can do is to spend more time in our communities, actually talking to people different than ourselves. We can dismantle micro-aggressions by building micro-bridges.  It used as an analogy how several different cultures in Africa and Asia have a greeting that translates not as "hello" but as “I see you.”  How different would the world be, the author asked, if we tried to genuinely care, and said “I see you” to every person we interact with?

Both of those messages had stuck with me.  I’m a blessed, fiscally independent, cheerful and outgoing woman in Silicon Valley.  And yet I live by myself, work long hours, and largely interact with people exactly like me.  In an effort to be less selfish, I resolved that the least I can do is say "yes" when people ask me for help.  My last month has been filled with little attempts to step up my outward expressions of compassion.  I’ve talked for extra hours to people having a rough time; I’ve emailed my networks to gather information for friends needing favors; I’ve volunteered to stay up late writing a couple legal letters for free.

So the minute I saw this woman, I knew I would help.  I stopped and pulled out my wallet – which only had $6 in it.  I took out the little bundle of one-dollar bills, and approached her.  And as I was about to just put the money in her hand and walk on, I felt a nudging.  *You see her.  Show her that you see her*.

"Hi!" I said cheerfully, looking right at her. “How are you doing?”

She burst into an enormous smile, happy that someone was talking to her directly.  "I’m doing ok," she responded.  “I’m trying to collect $50 today so I can buy some groceries.  I already have $12!”

I handed her my $6 – but felt in my soul *that’s not nearly enough.*

"Just groceries?" I asked.  “Do you want to go to that Safeway with me, right now? I’d be happy to use my card to buy you groceries.”

"Oh that’s very kind," she responded.  “But I’m waiting for my husband to arrive and help me – I’m too frail to carry a couple bags of groceries by myself on two different busses to get home. I thought I’d sit out here while I waited for him.  But thank you – what’s your name?”

"I’m Carolyn; what’s yours?"

"Mary."

"Bless you, Mary.  Have a nice afternoon."

I went inside and ordered my lunch.  But while surfing on my cell phone, the whispering voice in my soul kept chattering about Mary.  $50, to me, at this stage in my life, is so little.  And to her, right now, it’s food for her family for a week.  *I can give more. There has to be an ATM nearby*, I decided.

I left the restaurant out the back entrance, and found a bank a couple blocks away.  As I slid my debit card into the machine, a murmur of scripture slid across my thoughts. *Whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with her twain.* ([Matthew 5:41](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/5?lang=eng)).

Cash in hand, I wandered back across the shopping center.

"Mary," I greeted her, while handing her more cash. “I went to an ATM so you could get your groceries. You don’t need to sit out here all day.”

 Her eyes boggled as her hands clasped the bills, "how much is this?"

"$100."

"Oh bless you!" Mary exclaimed, springing to her feet and giving me a hug as tears filled her eyes.  Then she started babbling. “See, my husband took a job in Burlingame today and I don’t know when he’ll be done and I don’t know whether they’re going to pay him with cash or a check, but if it’s a check the banks are closed for the day and so I was worried I wouldn’t be able to cash it and use it to buy groceries, and so after I had finished my shift and while I was waiting for him I thought I would sit out here to make sure we could go shopping and now I don’t need to worry thank you thank you so much.”

My eyes got a little misty. "I’ve been wanting to be a better Christian," I said.  “And Jesus says to give people twice what they ask for.  So I thought I could do that for you.  I want you to know that people love you – I love you – God loves you.”

"I just can’t believe that you decided to be a good Christian to me, today," Mary answered, still hugging me gratefully.  I asked if I could get a picture with her.

"I always wondered how people took selfies!" she laughed as I flipped the camera on my iPhone.

I gave her another hug and wandered off to complete my walk to work, grateful for having made a new friend.

And as I’ve sat here at my desk, I’ve kept thinking about Mary’s parting words – her gratitude that I "decided to be a good Christian to *me* today."

*Not just you, Mary.  And not just today.* Christ loves every one of his children everyday.  In my feeble attempts to be Christlike, I pray I can do the same.
